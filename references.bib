  abstract     = {In 1983, Valentini presented a syntactic proof of cut-elimination for a sequent calculus {GLSV} for the provability logic {GL} where we have added the subscript v for “Valentini”. The sequents in {GLSV} were built from sets, as opposed to multisets, thus avoiding an explicit contraction rule. From a syntactic point of view, it is more satisfying and formal to explicitly identify the applications of the contraction rule that are ‘hidden’ in these set-based proofs of cut-elimination. But recently it has been claimed that Valentini’s arguments to eliminate cut do not terminate when applied to a multiset formulation of {GLSV} with an explicit rule of contraction. Here we refute this claim by placing Valentini’s arguments in a formal setting and proving cut-elimination for sequents built from multisets. The case of contractions above cut requires special care when the cut-formula is boxed. We deal with this case using a new transformation based on Valentini’s original arguments. Valentini’s original proof relies on a novel induction parameter called “width” which is computed “globally”. In his original proof, it is diﬃcult to verify the induction argument based on “width”. In our formulation however, veriﬁcation of this fact is straightforward.},
